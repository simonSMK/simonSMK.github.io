            In the Dagoreti community, there are many children who have become orphans through the effects of alcoholism or AIDS. Most of these children are now under the care of their grandparents and some are in children's centers. Felista is the founder and director of Dagoreti Early Child Intervention Program (DECIP). The family Felista came from struggled to provide food and education, which caused her to not receive an adequate education. As a single mother, she struggled to provide for her children. Since she had no food at home, she started washing people's clothes and prayed that one day she would be able to feed and educate children in the community. It is has been her mission to provide food and clothing, education, access to medical care, a clean and healthy environment, and to protect the rights of orphans and vulnerable children. These are part of community development initiatives to assist drug addicts, dropouts, street children, and HIV-infected and affected individuals. Funding is an essential part of the organization in order to have enough food for all the children, to be able to provide more space in order to provide outreach programs, to be able to pay bills and cover basic needs, and to be able to maintain staff and board structures.
