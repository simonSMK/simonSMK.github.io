            The Dagoreti Early Child Education Intervention Programme is an orphan organization that was initiated in the year 1989 and duly registered in 2000. It started off as a feeding program alleviating poverty among street children and later became a home in 2007 after the post election violence as a rescue initiative of abandoned children at Nairobi show ground near Kibra.
